## Python Projects for TechnoHack Virtual Internship

Welcome to the Python Projects repository created as part of the TechnoHack Virtual Internship. This repository contains several basic Python projects designed to help understand fundamental programming concepts and develop practical coding skills.

## Projects Included

### 1. Music Player

#### Description:
A simple music player application using Python. This project demonstrates the use of libraries like `pygame`, `tkinter`, and `customtkinter` for building a graphical user interface (GUI) and handling audio playback.

#### Key Features:
- Play, pause, and stop music.
- Skip forward and backward through a playlist.
- Display album cover and song details.
- Adjust volume with a slider.
- Track progress with a progress bar.

#### Concepts Covered:
- GUI development with `tkinter` and `customtkinter`.
- Audio handling with `pygame.mixer`.
- Multithreading for managing progress tracking.

### 2. ATM Simulation

#### Description:
A simulation of an ATM machine using Python. This project helps understand user interaction, data handling, and basic GUI development.

#### Key Features:
- Check account balance.
- Deposit and withdraw money.
- Validate user accounts.
- Display current time.

#### Concepts Covered:
- GUI development with `tkinter`.
- Handling user input and displaying output.
- Basic data handling and validation.

### 3. Tic Tac Toe Game

#### Description:
A classic Tic Tac Toe game built with Python. This project showcases event handling and game logic implementation within a GUI.

#### Key Features:
- Two-player gameplay (X and O).
- Button click handling.
- Win condition checking and announcing the winner.
- Option to reset the game.

#### Concepts Covered:
- GUI development with `tkinter`.
- Event handling and callback functions.
- Game logic implementation.
